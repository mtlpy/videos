# Videos for MtlPy

Videos of Montreal-Python talks ([mtlpy.org](http://mtlpy.org/videos/), [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/MontrealPython/videos))

## Status

Thanks to [Christian Aubry](https://twitter.com/ChristianAubry) (with [Savoir-Faire Linux](https://www.savoirfairelinux.com/)) and many MtlPy organisers, we published a lot of videos since 2008.

Now that Christian has some other projects to pursue, we want to own this and learn how to make amazing videos.

Take a look at our [setup](docs/video_setup.md).
